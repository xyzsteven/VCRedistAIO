## Overview

Many applications, especially games and productivity software, require specific versions of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages to run correctly. Forgetting to install them can lead to common errors like "missing MSVCP140.dll" or "side-by-side configuration is incorrect".

This All-in-One (AIO) package streamlines the installation process by bundling all the essential redistributables into a single installer, driven by a smart batch script.

## Features

- **Automated Installation**: Runs all installers in a single operation.
- **Silent & Passive Mode**: Installs all runtimes in the background with no user interaction required (`/q`, `/qb`, `/passive`).
- **Automatic Privilege Escalation**: The script automatically checks for administrator rights and will prompt for them if not found.
- **Smart Architecture Detection**: Automatically detects if your Windows OS is 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) and installs the appropriate runtimes.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes all major and commonly required Visual C++ Redistributable versions from 2005 to the present.
- **No Restarts**: The `/norestart` flag is used to prevent the system from automatically rebooting after each installation.
